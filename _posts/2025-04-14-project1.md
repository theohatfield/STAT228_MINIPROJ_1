## Practice in Visualization
This mini-project allowed me to practice data visualization and interpretation in R. I chose discuss a topic close to me! As a trans and gay guy I definitely think about how masculinity is percieved by other and how it shows up in my life. I thought it would be interesting to see a more statistical perspective on this!
